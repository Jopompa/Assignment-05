# Low Fidelity Prototype Assignment 05
## Introduction 
For my project I have chosen to change the design of Alaska's Department of Fish and Game website. The Department of Fish and Game ultimately wants to optimize public participation in fish and wildlife pursuits and increase public knowledge and confidence that wild populations of fish and wildlife are responsibly managed. This leads the webpage to encompass a wide variety of features that assist the many different groups of users. I am going to particularly focus on redesigning features that allow users to discover wild animal viewing locations and report wild life encounters. In doing so by creating this low-fidelity prototype I should gain a better understanding of the positives and negatives users encounter while manually manuevering through the website.

I have created two personas based off of user research and my own perception 

The first persona is a young adventerous girl named Brianna Castillo. She is a hard working mom that enjoys making time to take a break from her everyday life. However, being a full time mom and worker she doesnt have much time to be clicking through multiple webpages to find the information she needs. With a planned trip to Alaska she wants to her Wildlife viewing planning to go as quick and smoothly as possible, so she could just figure out where to go. She just wants to physically see and admire the wild animals so a location is all she needs.

The second persona is an older cautious lady by the name of Zinnia Ramirez. She has had some experience being in unknown land being that she has been travelling for the past three years after her retirement. Which leads her to do safety research before she flys out to her destination. Being an older lady her blood pressure rises in instances where she feels rushed so she doesn't want any of the safety tasks she has to complete to be overwhelming while she is in Alaska.

The scenarios I have created for each persona incorporate the features I am focusing on for this low-fidelity prototype which are wildlife viewing and wildlife encounter reports. The scenarios are: 
 
 - Brianna wants to discover locations in Alaska that are known for inhabiting Large moose and brown bears so she will go through the Department of Fish and Game's website to try and find that information.
 
 - Zinnia would like to fill out a wildlife encounter report form so that safety officials can quickly remove the wild animals from close proximity of hikers. 
 
## Tasks 

 - Finding moose and brown bear viewing locations. 
 - Filling out the wildlife encounter report form.
