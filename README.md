# Low Fidelity Prototype Assignment 05
## Introduction 
For my project I have chosen to change the design of Alaska's Department of Fish and Game website. The Department of Fish and Game ultimately wants to optimize public participation in fish and wildlife pursuits and increase public knowledge and confidence that wild populations of fish and wildlife are responsibly managed. This leads the webpage to encompass a wide variety of features that assist the many different groups of users. I am going to particularly focus on redesigning features that allow users to discover wild animal viewing locations and report wild life encounters. In doing so by creating this low-fidelity prototype I should gain a better understanding of the positives and negatives users encounter while manually manuevering through the website.

I have created two personas based off of user research and my own perception 

The first persona is a young adventerous girl named Brianna Castillo. She is a hard working mom that enjoys making time to take a break from her everyday life. However, being a full time mom and worker she doesnt have much time to be clicking through multiple webpages to find the information she needs. With a planned trip to Alaska she wants to her Wildlife viewing planning to go as quick and smoothly as possible, so she could just figure out where to go. She just wants to physically see and admire the wild animals so a location is all she needs.

The second persona is an older cautious lady by the name of Zinnia Ramirez. She has had some experience being in unknown land being that she has been travelling for the past three years after her retirement. Which leads her to do safety research before she flys out to her destination. Being an older lady her blood pressure rises in instances where she feels rushed so she doesn't want any of the safety tasks she has to complete to be overwhelming while she is in Alaska.

The scenarios I have created for each persona incorporate the features I am focusing on for this low-fidelity prototype which are wildlife viewing and wildlife encounter reports. The scenarios are: 
 
 - Brianna wants to discover locations in Alaska that are known for inhabiting large brown bears and she wants to know the best time of year to go see them, so she will go through the Department of Fish and Game's website to try and find that information.
 
 - Zinnia would like to fill out a wildlife encounter report form so that safety officials can quickly remove the wild animals from close proximity of hikers. 
 
## Tasks 

 - Finding brown bear viewing locations and the best time of year to view them. 
 - Filling out the wildlife encounter report form.

## Notes on User Testing
#### Task 1
After explaining what the system prototype was designed the do the user seemed to be confused as to where to start with the process of going through the prototype. He said that there was a lot of text on the screen which made it difficult to know where to start, however the guiding arrows and clearly labeled buttons/information helped lead him to the right place. After he finished the first part of task 1 which was trying the find where bear viewing is possible, he was stuck in moving to the second part of the task which was finding the best time of year to go view the bears at that certain location. There was no back button representation on the flow and I had to explain to the user that the second part started back on the first page. 

#### Task 2 
The user had little confusion when completing the second task. The user had understood the concept of prototype testing by this point and the task was a lot shorter and involved less interactions which made this task go by smoothly. 

## Reflection
Creating a low fidelity prototype involves a great amount of perspective taking. I say this because I realized this after creating the wireframes for tasks 1 & 2. I attempted to mentally go through the wireframes before adding guiding arrows and it became clear that any other person would not know what process to follow if there were no indicators or increased signs of interactions. This made me add a few more pages to task 1, which I felt made the process a little more understandable. However, after going through the first user test I feel like maybe adding captions at certain interaction points would allow the user to understand what is going to happen next, because although the arrows guided the user there was little context. And it seemed like the user relied too heavily on the arrows I drew, without really thinking about what section he was clicking on. In addition to this, I found an issue in the way I layed out the low fidelity prototype. Being that I illustrated the prototype on notebook paper I attached the pages to each other in a way that would shorten the overall length and this proved to confuse the user. I think that next time I should make smaller illustrations and format the prototype in a straight line as opposed to being stacked so there is a higher sense of flow, which should ultimately be less confusing for the user. I also believe that if I wouldâ€™ve indicated how one could return to the start page and begin the tasks again user testing would go a lot more smoothly and there would be less questions. Another issue I had was forgetting to record the instructions I explained to the user at the beginning of the task. The user had questions before he started but I was not able to capture it on video, so next time being prepared to more accurately capture user testing would be more beneficial as opposed to mentally recalling the questions the user had.
